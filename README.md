Abstract
The project aims to develop a demand forecasting model for sales prediction. The objective is to create a reliable tool to support inventory management and optimize sales strategies.  
The project began with comprehensive data preprocessing, including cleaning, aggregation, and the feature engineering to enable time series analysis. Exploratory data analysis of historical data revealed crucial business insights.  
The forecasting model is developed to predict future sales demand for each symbol over a two-month horizon. By focusing on the top 10 symbols who significantly contribute to overall sales actionable insights are ensured for improved decision making.  
The outcomes of this project aim to improve inventory management by reducing stockout and overstock situations leading to capital efficiency. The project highlights the value of data-driven decision-making in achieving business goals.

Future Scope
The demand forecasting model developed in this project lays the foundation for further improvements in predictive analytics and efficient inventory management. Future work could enhance the modelâ€™s accuracy by incorporating additional exogenous variables that drive business growth such as weather data, marketing campaigns, market conditions and more.
By including external aspects that could allow for real-time decision-making and the achievement of long-term objectives, the two-month projection can be extended across a wider time horizon.
Finally, the forecasting model could be scaled across different business segments making it serve as a versatile tool for overall business growth. This would ensure a comprehensive, data-driven approach to meeting consumer demand while minimizing operational inefficiencies.
Conclusion
This project successfully developed a demand forecasting model aimed at predicting sales, with a focus on the top 10 highest selling symbols.
The model offers practical insights to improve inventory planning and sales strategy through an organized process encompassing data cleaning, aggregation, and time series preparation.

Data-driven decision-making has been made possible by the combination of monthly demand data with symbol-specific forecasting, which has allowed for precise projections over a two-month horizon. The study emphasizes how crucial it is to use historical sales data and data analytics to tackle practical demand estimation issues.
This project highlights the need of real-world application in bridging the gap between technology and industry demands. 

Even though the model performed well with near accurate results, there is still room for improvement in the future, such as adding more external components, broadening the scope of the forecasting, and utilizing more sophisticated approaches. 
All things considered, the project is a big step in the right direction toward increasing supply chain effectiveness and efficient inventory management.
